# üöÄ Quick Start

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try it

Spin up a local **demo** of Uptimer in two simple commands:


```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull myuptime/uptimer

# Run the container in demo mode (all-in-one)
docker run -p 2517:2517 myuptime/uptimer
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:2517](http://127.0.0.1:2517) in your browser:

1. Add a website check (URL + interval)
2. Set up a Slack webhook for notifications

## üß™ Demo limitations

* Single built-in worker ‚Äî no multi-region support
* No authentication ‚Äî all users are treated as "Admin"
* No persistence ‚Äî all data is lost when the container stops

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:

The demo version is for local testing only.
Do not expose it to the internet. It has no authentication or security features.
